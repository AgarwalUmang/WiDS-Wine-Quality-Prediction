## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Implement Classification Algorithms using Sklearn like Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, etc. Just look up the algorithms on yt/web, how they work and how to use them on sklearn.Compare the results of all the algorithms you implemented using metrics like accuracy score, loss function etc

## LEARNING PART
With this project I got an brief introduction about Machine Learning. From the Andrew.N.G course I got to know about linear regression model,multiple linear regression model,ways to optimize cost function , loss function. This included getting familiarized with python libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn.
Getting in touch with pyhton language and its libraries was first goal, then grasping knowledge about ML through lecture and implementing it.

## TESTING AND RESULTS
On solving the problem statement, I had to just minimise the parameter *(width)* of the two-lines which try to bet fit/encompass my data. Moving on to implementation part, I used ***linear regression (polynomial , linear ,rbf, sigmoid) kernels*** to obtain accuracy for my tests. Using this I got about *65-67%* accuracy. Using ***K nieghbours classifier*** and manipulating its parameter I could get maximum accuracy of *48-49%*. Finally using the ***Random Forest Classifier*** I got the maximum accuracy of *71%*.
