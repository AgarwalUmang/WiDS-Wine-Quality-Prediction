# **WiDS - Wine Quality Prediction**
#### By - Siddharth Kaushik

#### Problem Statement
A dataset containing composition of varios wine samples as well as quality was provided. We first had to analyse the data using plots and graphs making use of the pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries. We then had to train the model using algorithms like Logistical Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classification so as to accurately predict the quality of wine from a provided dataset.

#### Learning Phase
I initially started out by learning python basics and the use of libraies like numpy and pandas.
Once I had got a grasp on python the mentors started proving adequate resouces for learning Machine Learning Algorithms. I audited a course by Andrew NG on Coursera for the same and that helped me get a good understanding on the basics with the help of their optional labs. Along with this I watched vides on SKlearn libraries too so as to understand the actual implementaion of ML algorithms in code.

#### Project Implementation and Issues Faced
During the actual project implementation my alorithms werent giving a good enough prediction and wasnt accurate. Here the mentors helped me understand what we can do to so as to better train the model and get an accurate prediction.
