## Introduction

The identification and classification of wine quality is a very important part of modern food production and trade. Wine contains about 97% of water and ethanol, remaining 3% of various other substances. These chemical compositions determine the organoleptic quality of the wine. 

Fluctuations in these chemicals can be observed by examining the physicochemical properties
of the wine. These physicochemical properties like pH value, alcohol content, sulfur content, anthocyanin content, and other properties of wine can greatly reflect its quality. 

Research on wine has revealed the interesting fact that there is an intrinsic link between the physicochemical features of the wine and that two or more features may work together to influence certain qualities of a wine.

Traditionally, wine quality assessment has relied on manual sensory evaluation. Disadvantages of this method are obvious: firstly, manual sensory evaluation relies on personal perception and may give different results based on the tester. Secondly, it lacks standardized quality evaluation criteria. 

Unlike humans, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the ability to remember and learn from massive amounts of data. After trained by large amount of data, AI can work regardless of subjective factors to adapt to modern massive production.
